## Introduction to Open Source Security

> The [Open Source Security Foundation](https://openssf.org/) website was very helpful as an introductory to open source security.

Open Source Software or OSS is typically developed by a community of volunteers, and its source code is open to the public to be easily used and modified. Due to the popularity of open source software in nearly every part of our everyday life, it can be used by developers to speed up application development time.

"Open-source security refers to the practice of ensuring the safety and security of computer systems and networks that use open-source software."

## 3 A's of OSS Security

Following MichaelCade's resoursces, a useful [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=baZH6CX6Zno) from IBM talked about 3 important things to look for before using an OSS.

- **Assess** - Look at how active repository is, how responsive are the maintainers? The OSS may not be one that is secure.

- **Adopt** - If you are going to take this on within your software or as a standalone app within your own stack, who is going to manage and maintain it? Set some policies on who internally will overlook the project and support the community.

- **Act** - Security is the responsibility of everyone, not just the maintainers, as a user you should also act and assist with the project.
