# Day 01

Following [@MichaelCade's](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/main/2023/day01.md) 2023 90DaysOfDevOps Challenge, day 1 served as a reflection of the previous year 2022 and focused on 4 things:

1. Continuous learning.
2. Security focused.
3. Getting help from friends.
4. Gathering learning resources.


Restarted with the [2022 course here](https://github.com/MichaelCade/90DaysOfDevOps/blob/main/2022/Days/day01.md)
