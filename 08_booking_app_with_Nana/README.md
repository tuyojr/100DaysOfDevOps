# Building A Simple Ticket Booking App With Nana Janashia

First, I started by following [Jake Wright - Learn Go in 12 minutes](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=C8LgvuEBraI) to get the basics syntax of golang. You can see the full list of things done in the [07_learning_a_programming_language](https://github.com/tuyojr/DaysOfDevOps/tree/main/07_learning_a_programming_language) folder.

Secondly, I proceeded to following [TechworldWithNana - Golang full course - 3 hours 24 mins](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=yyUHQIec83I) which was a more hands-on and practical approach to learning Go. In this video, we went through building a very simple CLI application that welcomed users to a conference, gave them some basic information about the conference, the number of available tickets, and prompted them for input to book their tickets.

Following this crash course, we were able to cover:

- What is Go?
- Characteristics of Go
- Installation (which was already done in 07_learning_a_programming_language)
- Variables and constants
- Formatted Output
- Data Types
- Getting User Input
- Pointers
- Book Ticket Logic
- Arrays and Slices
- Loops
- Conditionals
- Validate User Input
- Functions
- Packages
- Scopes
- Maps
- Structs
- Goroutines
