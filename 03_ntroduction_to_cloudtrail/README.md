Starting off, there's a need to understand what the attacker of our applcation wants to do and how they intend to go abouyt it. This perspective enables us to think like an attacker and understand the attack surface of our application.

## Attack Map

Attackers make use of a variety of tools and techniques to gain access to our application. The attack map is a visual representation of an attack on our application. It is a great way to understand the attack surface of our application and the tools and techniques that can be used to exploit it.

To create an attack map, we need to understand the following:

1. The attacker's goal.
2. The steps the attacker will take to achieve their goal.
3. The tools and techniques the attacker will use to achieve their goal.
4. Create a graphical representation of our application architecture.
5. Identify the attack surface of our application.
